# Colossal Cave Adventure browser port - 350 points version
Colossal Cave Adventure was originally written by programmer and cave explorer Will Crowther in 1976, based on the real-life Bedquilt Cave in Kentucky.  Crowther's game was greatly expanded by Don Woods, creating the famous 350 points version that influenced the development of the entire adventure game genre. Since then, the original has been repeatedly ported to many systems in many forms.  This JavaScript port aims to fix bugs from older ports and the original, introduce quality-of-life improvements, and be highly customizable so you can experience Colossal Cave the way you personally wish to.

The default settings are not entirely faithful to the original; they are aimed primarily at new players.  Like some other ports, they make the game a little bit kinder; pirate spawns are more reliable, and the end can be reached even with some mistakes. On the other hand, some exploits from the original are turned off.  Returning players can tweak these settings to recreate the original game, although some old bugs have been simply fixed.

Original game believed to be in public domain. No additional copyrights apply to the JavaScript port, although I would appreciate it if you don't remove my credit ;-)

NOTE: If the keyboard does not appear while playing on mobile, double-tap the screen or click the compass-like icon.

To-do list:
- Option to disable (more) dead end situations
- Option to display the score
- Handle dwarves after displaying room description
- Consider whether dwarves following us to end cave is okay
- Implement hints
- Verify that dropping the bird in cage works properly on resurrection
- Check item placement on deaths after falls
- Figure out why the game keeps saying "The grate is locked" in end room
